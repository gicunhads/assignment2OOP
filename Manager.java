/*The manager is an employee hired by his/her academic performance: 
she / he has a degree can be a BSc., MSc. and PhD. Each of those values yield a bonus of, respectively, 
10%, 20% and 35% to his/her gross salary. Note that the degree of a Manager is defined when creating the
 Manager and can be updated, thus automatically adjusting his/her gross salary.
  Be careful not to lose the original gross salary established in the Employee’s creation, 
  since the bonus is not cumulative!! For instance: Mary has a gross salary of 10,000 SEK. With a BSc. 
  her gross salary will receive a bonus of 10% (1,000 SEK). When Mary gets a MSc., her bonus will be 20% of her 
  initial gross salary, hence 2,000 SEK. 

String representation for Managers:

<degree> <name>’s gross salary is <gross_salary> SEK per month. */
